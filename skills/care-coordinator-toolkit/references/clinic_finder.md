## `clinic_finder.py` — the nearest clinics to a point

**Use when** she asks where to go, or an artifact needs a place and a distance.

**Requires:** `snapshot_path`, an `origin` giving `longitude` **then** `latitude`
— GeoJSON order — and at least one of `limit` and `radius_metres`.

**Source of truth:** a dated snapshot under `references/`, written by a
person running `tools/fetch_references.py`. An edited one is refused; over 30
days old still answers, marked `stale`.

**Never call the distance a walk.** It is a straight line rounded to 10 m: no
route was worked out, and nothing says whether the way is step-free. Quote the
record's `summary`, which says so. `programmes` is a dataset fact and settles
nothing about any person.

**Never write this map by hand.** `supply_channel` is copied from the household
file, never inferred from a medicine's name. A medicine with none recorded is
**left out**, so the cart reports it unknown and asks — the one field where a
confident guess puts a prescription medicine in a shopping cart.

An optional `purchase` block carries `pack_size` and a price. A price needs a
`currency` **and** a `source`; recording one against a medicine with no channel
raises, rather than being accepted and never used.
